# AWS Firehose Repeater

Guess what!  
You _can't_ point AWS Firehose at your internal VPC!  
**That sucks!**

This uses the `Firehose -> S3` Path to allow you to pretend to be firehose inside of your private vpc.

# WARNING

* **We build weekly!**   
  We shoot our feet here: Every tag will track! 

* Not 1:1
* Some Jankâ„¢
* Not Volume Tested
* Limits from official spec NOT enforced (i.e. 10k records limit, 1Mi record limit etc. )
* Spaces in S3 keys not supported.
* Good Enough

# Setup AWS Firehose

You need to setup AWS firehose with:

* Pointing to a s3 bucket of your choice.
* Newline delimiter enabled
* File extention is set to `.json.gz`

# Env Variables

* `FIREHOSE_TARGET`  
  The API target URL  
  e.g. `https://example.com/api/v1/firehose`

* `FIREHOSE_KEY`  
  The "API Key" on your receiving end.  
  e.g. `somesecr3t`

* `FIREHOSE_COMMON_ATR`  
  The Common attributes header  
  e.g. `{"commonAttributes":{}}`

* `S3_BUCKET`  
  The s3 bucket name.  
  e.g. `some-bucket-name`

* `S3_PREFIX`  
  The prefix under which to pull from  
  e.g. `firehose/output/`

* `S3_DELETE`  
  Enable deletion of s3 object after processing. Unset or null to dry-run  
  e.g. `any-value`
  > keeping this off will result in duplicates!  
  > you should keep this on after you have tested your target.

* `NPROCS`  
  The amount of process to run in parralel for upload  
  e.g. `0` for auto

* `FD_DEBUG`  
  Enable debug output  
  e.g. `/dev/stderr` or `/tmp/debug.logs`

* `CURL_EXTRA_OPTS`
  The final POST curl's extra options.  
  e.g. `--insecure`

* `AWS_REGION`
  You should set this.
  e.g. `aq-central-1`

* `AWS_*`
  You should be able to set any of the normal `AWS_` env vars.

# FAQ

## Why do the s3 get with a curl request?

Well see, aws-cli runs on python, try to do `cat s3objects.big.list | xargs -P0 -I{} aws s3 cp {} -` and see what happens to your resources.

## Why do the weird `printf`, `cat` json generation instead of using `jq`?

Could not figure out how to `--slurp + --stream` the output into an array without using all my memory, feel free to open a PR if you know how.  

## Why `--squash-all`?

I wish I could do `--layers=true --squash` but there is an [issue](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/20824) with that combo.  
> `--sqaush` combines all the built layers into one and then puts it on top of the base image (great for userside layer efficiency),  
> `--squash-all` does the same but also combines the base layer.

## Why bash? Why not fish?

Dammit I should have started with that `:(`

## Why not use **[PROGRAMING LANGUAGE]**?

It's my [Cursed Hammer](https://loststeak.com/if-programming-languages-were-weapons/#bash) and I get to hit every ~~thumb~~ _Nail_ I see!

## What's up with the Container annotations?

Not well supported by podman, the annotations from Alpine fall through to the main layer. So I have to set them all. `:(`

## I have an s3 key with a space in, it's not working!

If you need this functionality, please open a PR.
